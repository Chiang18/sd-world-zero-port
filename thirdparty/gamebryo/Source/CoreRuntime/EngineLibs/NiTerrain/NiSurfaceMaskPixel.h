    A wrapper class around a pixel inside a surface mask that is used to
    retrieve the value of the mask at the corresponding point and to store
    quadtree information to be used by deformation.

    A pixel object will only ever be created for a pixel that has been 
    requested for deformation, the mask will not have pixel objects created for
    it unless they have been specifically requested.
