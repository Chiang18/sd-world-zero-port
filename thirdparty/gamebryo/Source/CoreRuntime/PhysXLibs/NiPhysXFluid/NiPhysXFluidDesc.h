/**
    NiPhysXFluidDesc objects are the Gamebryo descriptor objects for a
    PhysX NxFluid object.
    
    They store a NxFluidDesc object, a pointer to the NxFluid we are
    describing (after it has been instantiated) and additional
    data required to attach a fluid to a Gamebryo scene graph. Streaming
    and cloning is supported. 

    An object of this type is created and streamed when a fluid particle
    system is exported from the art tools. The most common application
    usage of this class will be to modify parameters between the loading
    of a NiPhysXScene and the instantiation of PhysX content using
    NiPhysXScene::CreateSceneFromSnapshot(). See the PhysXFluids demo
    for an example of using this class.
    
    This class may also be used to clone fluid data in tandem with the scene
    graph that is rendering the fluid. 

    This class does not stream userData stored in the NxFluid. Applications
    should derive from this class if explicit handling of userData is required.
