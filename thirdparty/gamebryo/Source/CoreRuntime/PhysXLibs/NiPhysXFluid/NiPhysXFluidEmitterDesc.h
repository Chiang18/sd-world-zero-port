/**
    NiPhysXFluidEmitterDesc objects are the Gamebryo descriptor objects for
    a PhysX NxFluidEmitter object.
    
    Each instance stores a NxFluidEmitterDesc object, a pointer to the
    NxFluidEmitter it is describing (after it has been instantiated), and a
    pointer to a NiPhysXActorDesc object if the emitter is attached to an
    actor's frame. 

    An object of this type is created and streamed for each emitter when a
    fluid particle system is exported from the art tools. The most common
    application usage of this class is to modify parameters between
    the loading of a NiPhysXScene and the instantiation of PhysX content
    using NiPhysXScene::CreateSceneFromSnapshot(). This class can also be
    used to clone fluid data in tandem with the scene graph that is rendering
    the fluid. 

    This class does not stream userData stored in the NxFluidEmitter.
    Applications should derive from this class if explicit handling of
    userData is required.
