/**
    NiPhysXProp objects hold information about a PhysX prop, that is, part
    of a Gamebryo scene that is controlled by, or controls, a PhysX actor
    (including cloth, fluids or particles).
    
    Props are added to NiPhysXScene objects to activate them in the PhysX
    scene. A prop is the smallest "unit" for PhysX objects, and is intended
    to hold a self-contained thing, such as a crate, a rag-doll, or a physical
    machine. The same prop can be cloned to create many instances of the same
    object. Props are also the objects exported in NIF files in the Gamebryo
    art pipeline.
    
    Each prop hold a description of the PhysX contents that the prop
    represents, along with the objects that relate the PhysX content to the
    Gamebryo scene (NiPhysXSrc objects, NiPhysXDest objects, and
    NiMesh objects with PhysX-related modifiers).
    
    In addition, each prop holds a transformation that is applied to all
    PhysX poses and velocities when the prop is created in a scene. The
    transformation places the object relative to the global coordinate
    system of the NxScene that the prop is created in. This transformation
    is intended to allow clones of a prop template to be easily placed in
    different locations in the scene. Note that it is only used when the
    PhysX content is instantiated - it has no effect once the objects have
    been created.
    
    The scale factor relating the PhysX coordinate system to the Gamebryo
    coordinate system is stored as a convenience. This scale should match
    that specified for the NiPhysXScene that the prop is attached to.
    
    The prop also keeps a flag that controls the handling of PhysX collision
    mesh data. In almost all cases this flag should be false so that mesh
    data is deleted once the mesh is instantiated in the PhysX SDK. If this
    flag is true, then the cooked mesh data is kept for later use.
    Applications would only do this if they were planning to explicitly
    release the mesh object from the PhysX SDK and create it again later,
    or if planning to release the SDK and recreate all physics content again
    later. However, in this case it may be better to stream the scene in
    again.

        A snapshot is the state of all the Gamebryo-supported elements of a
        PhysX scene. The snapshot is used to stream the PhysX content and to
        provide streaming, cloning and reset functionality on actor poses and
        velocities. Each NiPhysXProp keeps a single snapshot (possibly NULL),
        which in turn contains multiple snapshot states for each actor and
        material. The individual actor states can be accessed directly, or
        the functions in NiPhysXScene can be used to manipulate the states
        on all actors in the scene. The two approaches should not be mixed
        because the state indexes will become confused.
