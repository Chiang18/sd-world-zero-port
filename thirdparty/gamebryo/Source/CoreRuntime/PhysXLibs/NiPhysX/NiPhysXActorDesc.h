/**
    NiPhysXActorDesc objects are for caching snapshots of NxActor objects,
    used for streaming, cloning and restoring simulation state.
    
    The primary reason for an application to create an NiPhysXActorDesc
    object is to ease cloning of PhysX content in code, or to specify a
    particle actor for a PhysX-based particle system. However, applications
    can also access these objects between loading a NIF file containing
    NiPhysXProp objects and instantiating the PhysX scene. This enables
    post-load modification of the properties of actors and is an important
    way to overcome limitations in the authoring of PhysX content. 

    The class stores the state necessary to create a PhysX actor and to
    create the actor's links with a Gamebryo scene graph. After the PhysX
    content has been instantiated, the class also contains a pointer to the
    NxActor object created from the description. Multiple initial conditions
    may be stored, enabling the actor to be reset to a variety of poses.

    @note This class does not cache the userData associated with the actor.
        Applications should derive from this class if they wish to cache or
        stream such data.

        that are assumed by Gamebryo-PhysX to be constant for the lifetime
        of an actor (once that actor has been created).

        All of the properties correspond to the contents of an NxActorDesc,
        but use Gamebryo types that support streaming. The pkBodyDesc
        argument is stored in a smart pointer. The shape array is
        copied.

        The set functions only modify the value stored in this object, which
        is used when the actor is first created and for streaming and cloning.
        It does not modify the property of an already existing NxActor created
        from the object. If you would like to modify an existing actor, use
        the GetActor function to obtain the NxActor object and set the
        property using a function call on that.
