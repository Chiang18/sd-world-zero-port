/**
    A source in the Gamebryo-PhysX package is a link between a Gamebryo node
    that is being driven by animation and a PhysX actor that is intended to
    in some way mirror the behaviors in the physics simulation.
    
    NiPhysXSrc is an abstract base class from which all such objects are
    derived.
    
    In addition to decalring virtual update functions, the class stores a flag
    indicating activity and another controlling interpolation of state.
    Derived classes should only transfer state if the source is active (unless
    forced), and should implement interpolation in an appropriate form.

        They are split into two functions because the second, UpdateToActors
