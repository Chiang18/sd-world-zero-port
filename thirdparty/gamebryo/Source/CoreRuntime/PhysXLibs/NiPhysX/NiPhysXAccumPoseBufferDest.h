/**
    Each NiPhysXAccumPoseBufferDest connects a PhysX rigid body actor to 
    two rotation and two translation data items within the NiPoseBuffer 
    owned by the active animation sequence. The location of this data
    matches the output of the sequence evaluators for the accumulated
    root of the character as well as its non-accumulated child. These  
    data values form transforms which, after blending with pose buffer 
    data from other active sequences, ultimately drive the scene graph 
    accumulation root node and its non-accumulated child.
    
    Most of its functionality is derived from the base classes. This class 
    only adds the final step of interpolating the PhysX results and pushing 
    them into the pose buffer.

    This class should be used in conjunction with a NiPhysXSequenceManager
    object, in which case applications will never need to create one and will
    never need to explicitly call any of its functions. The code that adds a
    sequence to the NiPhysXSequenceManager creates these objects as part of
    its setup and continues to manage them.

    @note Interpolation will fail for fast rotating objects due to the
        fundamental limitations of rotation representations and discrete
        time sampling. Disable interpolation for fast moving objects.
