/**
    NiPhysXPropDesc objects are for caching the data required to create
    PhysX objects and attach them to a scene graph.
    
    In addition, they can store multiple copies of pose and velocity
    information. They are the objects streamed to save or load PhysX actors
    (rigid, cloth and fluid) and are the objects stored as snapshots in
    NiPhysXProp objects. Instances of this class are typically created in
    art tools, or modified after loading from a stream but before
    instantiating the PhysX.
    
    NiPhysXPropDesc also implement cloning behavior for PhysX content.
