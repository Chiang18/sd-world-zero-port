// This class is designed to help when cloning sets of entities. It has two
// primary functions that are not handled by NiEntityInterface::Clone.
// 1) It clones prefabs atomically. The standard Clone function, when given
//    a prefab root, will clone the root but not the prefab entities. This
//    class will clone the entire prefab and will contain pointers to all
//    of the entities that were cloned as a result.
// 2) Reference fixup. The standard Clone function does not change entity
//    reference pointers. If two entities are cloned, and one refers to the
//    other (i.e. lights), then it will still point to the original entity,
//    not the new clone. This is often wrong, especially in the case of
//    prefabs. This class will make a followup pass and fixup all references
//    to cloned objects.
//
// It should be used by instantiating the clone helper, then calling the
// Clone function for each entity in the set. When it is done, you should
// call the Fixup function to fixup any entity pointers.
