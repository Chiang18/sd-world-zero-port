/**
    The palette contains and manages a collection of surface packages and keeps
    a searchable index of surface tags.
    
    The palette should be used to make any modifications to surfaces or
    packages, so that the caches stay intact.

    The surface palette is not owned by a single terrain, it should be regarded
    as a singleton that is referenced across all terrain instances. The
    surface palette should be owned and managed by the same code base that
    is responsible for managing the terrain entities themselves.
