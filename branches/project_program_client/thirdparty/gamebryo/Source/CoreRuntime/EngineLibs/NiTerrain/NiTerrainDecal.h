/**
    This class represents a decal that will be placed on a terrain sector. The 
    decal mesh will form itself around the terrain geometry and be placed 
    slightly above the terrain mesh itself for rendering purposes.

    Decals support alpha decay over time, as well as a life span. When a decal
    reaches the end of its life span, the owner of the decal will need to 
    remove the decal from the terrain, it is not done by the decal itself.
