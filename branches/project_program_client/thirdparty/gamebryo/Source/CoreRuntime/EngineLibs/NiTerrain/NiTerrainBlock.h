/**
    NiTerrainBlock objects represent the renderable geometry of the terrain.
    
    The NiNode class is extended to store an additional list of children, that
    holds ONLY block children and will only ever contain either 0 or 4
    children. The base-class list of children contains not only the block
    children, but also the mesh. This results in either having 1 or 5 children.
    
    The mesh is stored as a child so that NiDynamicEffect objects propagate
    correctly, and the mesh responds correctly to the UpdateEffects function.
    This also allows the client application to gain direct access to the
    meshes, in order to attach NiProperty objects.
