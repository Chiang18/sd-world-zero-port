/**
    An implementation of PhysX's UserContactModify base class that allows for
    highly accurate readings of the PhysX meta data from terrain materials.
    Meta data from each material present at the collision point is weighted
    and merged to give a true reading.

    It is important that once an instance of this class has been created, the
    scale factor is set to match that of the PhysX scene via the SetScaleFactor
    function.

    @note Using any UserContactModify derived class will have a significant 
        impact on performance and is not recommended by the PhysX documentation.
