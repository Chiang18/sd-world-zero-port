/**
    Each NiPhysXPoseBufferDest connects a PhysX rigid body actor to 
    one rotation and one translation data item within the NiPoseBuffer 
    owned by the active animation sequence. The location of this data
    matches the output of a given sequence evaluator. These data 
    values form a transform which, after blending with pose buffer 
    data from other active sequences, ultimately drive a scene graph 
    transform node.
    
    Most of its functionality is derived from the base classes. This class 
    only adds the final step of interpolating the PhysX results and pushing 
    them into the pose buffer.

    This class should be used in conjunction with a NiPhysXSequenceManager
    object, in which case applications will never need to create one and will
    never need to explicitly call any of its functions. The code that adds a
    sequence to the NiPhysXSequenceManager creates these objects as part of
    its setup and continues to manage them.

    @note Fast Spinning Objects: Interpolation will fail for fast rotating
        objects due to the fundamental limitations of rotation representations
        and discrete time sampling. Disable interpolation for fast moving
        objects.

        this pushes the most recently extracted transformation into 
        the target pose buffer locations. See the base class 
        documentation for how this transformation is computed.

        to interpolate or extrapolate from the two most recently 
        extracted transforms (the work is done by the base class).
