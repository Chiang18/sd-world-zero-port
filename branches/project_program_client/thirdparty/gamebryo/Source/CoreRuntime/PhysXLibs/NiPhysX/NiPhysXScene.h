    /**
        @name Simulation Functions 

        NiPhysXScene objects provide the interface to NxScene::simulate()
        and NxScene::fetchResults() calls. Applications must always work
        through these functions to maintain a consistent simulation state.
        These functions enforce various rules related to simulation, such as
        making certain that simulate and fetchResults are always interleaved.

        The NiPhysXScene object takes complete control over the timing of the
        physics scene. Applications should not make any calls to
        NxScene::setTiming - they will be over-ridden by this object.
    
        Some of these functions control the time step that Gamebryo uses
        when calling simulate() for this scene and the time steps that
        PhysX uses. If active, fixed stepping uses a multiple of the given
        time step (set through SetTimestep) sufficient to get to or surpass
        the requested update time, otherwise it uses the difference between
        the target time and the most recent time (which depends on how the
        application calls update). The PhysX scene is set to use the same
        stepping mechanism, fixed or variable, as this object. The max time
        step passed to NxScene::setTiming is controlled by SetNumSubSteps:
        maxTimestep = fStep / uiNumSteps. The argument to SetMaxNumSteps is
        the same as would be passed as the maxIter argument to
